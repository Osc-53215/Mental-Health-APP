# Mental-Health-APP

I'm making this application in close relation to my Girlfriend who is currently pursing her PhD in counseling psych. The audience for this application will be for underrepresented students in higher education. This application will not substitute actual psychological diagnosis instead provide resources to those students who feel underrepresented.

The application will consist of :
1. Main feed is going to be daily quotes used to encourage students.  
2. Resources the students can use
3. A donations page for mental health foundations
4. About me page so my girlfriend can give a intro into who she is and what her plans are for her psychology career
5. If time allows it attempt the messaging application and tie it into another link on the main application where students can sign up to allow for messaging in groups or in a private setting
6. A donations page for mental health foundations

Technologies: React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, REDUX, Firebase, Firebase Hooks     

The WOW factor in this appication is the users experience finding comfort on campus when studying and feeling discouraged. This application will bring together all underrepresented students and hopefully create a better atmosphere through the years of studying. I want to be able to improve there lifestyle as students and bring out the best in them without feeling discouraged. I think if I implement the messaging feature this will really enlighten the user experience providing a private source for interacting with a Psychologist and giving them comfort in feeling "heard" on campus!
