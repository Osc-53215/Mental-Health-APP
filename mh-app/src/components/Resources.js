            <p>Rise trains and hires community college and university students to organize
                campaigns focused on eliminating tuition and fees, expanding financial aid and

                ending student hunger and homelessness. Although Rise students work

                nationwide, the primary focus states in 2020 were California, Georgia, Michigan,
                Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Given the rising costs of education and the barrier
                it places on underrepresented students when pursuing higher education, this
                resource is useful in helping first-generation Latine students identify and advocate
                for their needs. This resource embodies social justice by creating a team of people
                prepared to address educational disparities.
